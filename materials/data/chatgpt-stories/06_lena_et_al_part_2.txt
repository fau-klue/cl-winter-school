Across Time and Disciplines

Lena, Wei, and Ming looked around, confused, trying to take in their new surroundings. They noticed a person dressed in medieval clothing and holding a fresh baguette. The person was staring at them with a look of confusion and curiosity.

Lena: "What the... where are we? This doesn't look like campus anymore."

Wei: "Oh mein Gott, was ist passiert? Ich kann nicht glauben, dass wir uns plötzlich im Mittelalter befinden." (Translation: "Oh my God, what happened? I can't believe we suddenly find ourselves in the Middle Ages.")

Ming: (in Chinese) "这是哪里？我们怎么会来到这里？" (Translation: "Where are we? How did we end up here?")

The French person approached them, still holding the baguette, and spoke to them in French.

French person: "Qui êtes-vous? D'où venez-vous?" (Translation: "Who are you? Where do you come from?")

Lena: "I'm sorry, we don't speak French. Do you speak English, German, or Chinese?"

Wei: "Entschuldigung, wir sprechen kein Französisch. Können Sie Englisch oder Deutsch sprechen?" (Translation: "Sorry, we don't speak French. Can you speak English or German?")

Ming: (in Chinese) "对不起，我们不会说法语。你会说中文吗？" (Translation: "Sorry, we don't speak French. Can you speak Chinese?")

The French person looked at them with a mix of confusion and suspicion, but didn't seem to understand what they were saying. They continued to speak to them in French.

French person: "Vous êtes étrangers. Vous devez partir d'ici." (Translation: "You are foreigners. You must leave here.")

Lena: "I don't think they understand us. How are we going to get out of here?"

Wei: "Ich weiß nicht. Wir müssen irgendwie eine Möglichkeit finden, zurück in unsere Zeit zu reisen." (Translation: "I don't know. We need to find a way to travel back to our own time somehow.")

Ming: (in Chinese) "我们应该尝试, 与这个人交流, 看看能否了解这个时期的生活和文化。" (Translation: "We should try to communicate with this person and see if we can learn about the life and culture of this era.")

As they continued to talk, the French person walked away, leaving them alone in the streets of medieval Paris with the sound of church bells ringing in the distance. They realized they had no idea how they would get back to their own time, but decided to try to make the most of the experience and learn as much as they could about life in the Middle Ages.
