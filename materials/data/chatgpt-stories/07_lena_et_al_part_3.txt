Lena, Wei, and Ming were in a state of shock when they found themselves transported to medieval Paris. They were surrounded by unfamiliar buildings and people dressed in strange clothes.

Wei turned to Lena and asked, "Was ist passiert? Wo sind wir?"

"I have no idea," Lena replied. "But it looks like we've been transported back in time."

Ming nodded in agreement. "這絕對不是現代的巴黎"

They had always thought of time travel as a hypothetical concept, but here they were, in the flesh, standing in the middle of a bustling medieval city.

As they walked through the narrow, winding streets, the locals looked at them with suspicion. They spoke in French, a language none of the PhD students understood.

"We need to find a way to communicate with them," Lena said, frustrated.

Wei suggested, "Nehmen wir doch unsere Handys? Wir können DeepL verwenden, um mit ihnen zu kommunizieren. Wie schwer kann das sein?"

Lena and Ming looked at him skeptically, but they decided it was worth a try.

Lena typed in a message in English, and Wei used the app to translate it into French. They approached a group of locals and showed them the translated message on their phones.

The locals looked at the phones suspiciously and spoke to each other in French. Finally, one of them said, "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" Sadly, none of them could read.

Ming decided to try something different. She spoke to them in Chinese and used hand gestures to try and convey their situation. To their surprise, the locals seemed to understand.

The group was taken to a wise woman who lived in the outskirts of Paris. The woman was initially suspicious of them, but they managed to convince her that they were not a threat.

Over the next few weeks, the three PhD students spent time with the wise woman, learning the language and customs of medieval France. Lena, being the linguistics expert, was able to pick up the language quickly, and Wei and Ming soon followed.

They also applied their knowledge from their respective fields to help the locals. Ming, the doctor (well, almost), helped cure an outbreak of the plague, while Wei and Lena helped build a primitive communication device.

Finally, after many months, they were able to construct a machine that could transport them back to their own time. The wise woman bade them farewell and wished them well on their journey.

"Allons-y!", they exclaimed. As they stepped through the portal and back into the modern era, Lena, Wei, and Ming looked at each other in amazement.

"We did it," Lena said, smiling.

Wei replied in German, "Wir haben es zusammen geschafft!"

Ming, speaking in Chinese, said, "我們永遠不會忘記在中世紀巴黎所學到的東西"

They looked at each other, knowing that their experience had brought them closer together and taught them to appreciate the value of communication and cooperation.
