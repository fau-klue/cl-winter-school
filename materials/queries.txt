„[T]here is a special case of drive which only occurs in the resultative construction. This sense of drive constrains the result-goal argument to mean ‘crazy’[.]“ (Goldberg 1995:79)

(1) Chris drove Pat mad/bonkers/bananas/crazy/over the edge.
(2) *Chris drove Pat silly/dead/angry/happy/sick.

First query (using an English Twitter corpus like this one: https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/cqpweb/corona_en/)
[lemma="drive"] [word="me|him|her|you|them|us"] a:[pos="[AN]"] within tweet show a .. matchend

Frequency breakdown shows mostly expected results. But there are also a few sentences that, according to Goldberg, shouldn't be possible:

(3) Covid undoubtedly struck some people hard and drove them dead.
(4) This covid bs is driving me broke. 

In a footnote, Goldberg acknowledges that other resultatives such as *to suicide* or *to drink* are also possible.

„These cases indicate that ‘crazy’ is perhaps too narrow, and that the meaning of the result-goal argument is better described as ‘to a state where normal mental processing is not possible’.“ (Goldberg 1995:234)

Some example queries for German (use a large Web or newspaper corpus):
*X macht mich Y* ('X makes me Y'):
[lemma="machen"] [word="mich|dich|sie|ihn|euch|uns|einen"] a:[pos="ADJD"] within s show a .. matchend

*um X' willen* ('for X' sake'):
[word="um" %c] []{1,3} [word="willen"] within s

Reduplication with preposition, e.g. *Auge um Auge* ('an eye for an eye'), *Zug um Zug*:
a:[pos="NN"] [pos="APPR"] b:[] :: a.word = b.word within s
This should also work:
a:[pos="NN"] [pos="APPR"] [word = a.word] within s

Dativus possessivus, e.g. *meinem Vater sein Bruder*:
[word="meinem|deinem|seinem|ihrem|dem"] [pos="NN"] [word="sein" & pos="PPOSAT"] within s
=> Still many false positives
